# MathGen
This is the math worksheet generator project.

Currently, it generates 2-digit addition problems.

To run, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system, and also LaTex (you need to be able to run the program pdflatex from the command prompt).

It's an experiment, and I'm using it to teach some new programmers about GitHub, version control, collaboration, and so on.

More detailed instructions will be available on my blog.
